# IaC
### Infrastructure as Code
---
Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.

## Ansible
- we use for configuration management
- agentless (agents dont need ansible)
- create master node
- as many agent nodes to implement
- install dependencies on controller to make it controller
- can do hybrid cloud with ansible
