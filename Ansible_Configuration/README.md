# Ansible

## What is ansible
Ansible is a suite of software tools that enables infrastructure as code. It is open-source and the suite includes software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment functionality.

## Why ansible
Benefits of ansible include:
- Simple to set up and use 
- Powerful, lets you model complex workflows
- Flexible
- Agentless, this means you do not have to install any additional software on the machines managed by ansible. This removes a potential single point of failure which helps with high availability 
- Enables hybrid cloud integration


## Ansible dependencies 
- python 2.7 or above
- Ansible repo link
- install ansible
- update & upgrade
**ONLY FOR CONTROLLER BECAUSE ANSIBLE IS AGENTLESS**
